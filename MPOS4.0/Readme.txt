MPOS 4.0 | Readme File |
-----------------------------------

Welcome to the new MPOS 4.0, now on SVN on Github.
This package contains;

- MW2 Stuff
- MPOS

The sub-folder 'Workstation' in the folder 'MP-OS 4.0' contains a file called 'Admin GB Password',
this is not a valid password and usenamer anymore.
These credentials were from the old version 2.0, and I still had it in the root folder of the 4.0.
(This file will me removed in the next rev.)
