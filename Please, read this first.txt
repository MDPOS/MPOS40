Some note:

This is our test account only, our real account has yet to be made, all of our Admins are currently busy doing updates
on the site and on the SVN, also we're working on the MPOS4.0 Beta version, which includeds Me, Davey, and Demian.

All three of us cannot create a new account on Github for M&D Productions, since we're not of the Administration
Department.

I (Mitchel) am the Owner of M&D Productions, together with Demian, Davey is our lead Admin together with Johathan and
James.

Our employees of the Administration Departmed haven't been very busy lately, they always have a day of since there is just
nothing to do for them, because we're all working on project based of an .exe installer.

And not of an SVN, so they still have to make the real M&D Productions Account on github, when the time comes, you'll
recieve an update in your SVN-Reposotory that we have switched accounts, and this one will be deleted.

Thanks you for reading,

Â© M&D Productiions,
Mod Mitchel, Davey, Demian.
